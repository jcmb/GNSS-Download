    IP   
    Format {HATANAKA,HATANAKAZ,KML,KMP,CSV,RINEX,RINEXZ,T0X}

Trimble GNSS Download.

positional arguments:
  IP                    GNSS receiver IP
  Format 				    {HATANAKA,HATANAKAZ,KML,KMP,CSV,RINEX,RINEXZ,T0X}
                        Format of file to download

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --RINEX {2.11,2.12,3.00,3.02,3.03,3.04}
                        Specify the RINEX version (allowed: 2.11, 2.12, 3.00, 3.02, 3.03, 3.04 )
  --Port PORT, -P PORT  HTTP HTTP Port of the GNSS Receiver, Default: 80.
  --Base BASE, -B BASE  Base Directory to Download from. Default: Internal.
  				Internal is the default.  
  				
  --Output OUTPUT, -O OUTPUT
                        Directory to Download to. Default Download in the current directory
  --Max MAX, -M MAX     Max number of downloads. Unlimited otherwise
  --Recursive, -R       Download from the Base directory and below
  		Required if the files are not being stored in a flat directory format.
  --Delete, -D          Delete file after downloading, Not implemented
  --Clobber, -C         Overwrite Existing
  		Without this files will not be downloaded if the already exist.
  --Quite, -Q           Quite, do not show progress. Disabled if output redirected.
  --NoRename            Do not rename files to the name browser would download.
  		Turning off Renaming will make the download faster when there is a signficant number of existing files. Note turning this on will re-download all of the existing files. 
  		Does not make a difference for T0X and KML Types. 
  --DryRun              DryRun, do not delete. Not implemented
  --Verbose, -V         Verbose
  --Tell, -T            Show Settings in use.
  
```
  
  Formats are

	*   T0X  
			Trimble T02 or T04 file without conversion.
	*   KML
			KMZ File with the positions as lines. The KMZ is generated by the receiver.
	*   KMP
			KMZ File with the positions as lines and point markers. The KMZ is generated by the receiver.
	*   CSV
			CSV File with the positions from the KMZ (Points) generated by the receiver. See KMZ_Decode.py for more details
			
	*   RINEX
			RINEX Observation File. Generated by the receiver
	*   RINEXZ
			RINEX Observation & Ephemeris in a zip File. Generated by the receiver
	*   HATANAKA
			HATANAKA Compressed RINEX Observation File. Generated by the receiver
	*   HATANAKAZ
			HATANAKA Compressed RINEX Observation & Ephemeris in a zip File. Generated by the receiver

The RINEX and HATANAKA files will be 3.04 unless the --RINEX parameter is passed to creat a different version.
